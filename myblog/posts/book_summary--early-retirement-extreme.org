** Plan vs Strategy
  -  A plan is a string of actions. One action fail, all fail. Fragile.
  -  A strategy is a web of actions. can't go this way then go another
    way. it means having logical constraints in your head (similar to
    numerical programming) which exposes you to a set of path you can
    choose to execute (and diverge later as long as the new path satisfies
    the constraints)
