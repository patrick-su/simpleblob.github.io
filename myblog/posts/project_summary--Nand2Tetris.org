** Introduction
- we are learning 3 things:
  1. how computers work, 
  2. how to break complex problems into manageable modules, 
  3. how to develop large-scale hardware and software systems.
- how codes work:
  1. write C sourcecode in file
  2. file is compiled into machine-level codes
  3. machine-level codes (binary code-map) are executed by a chipset -- register, memory, ALU.
  4. all the hardware stuff in 3. >> they are all logic-gates.
- abstractions - we use it to "split off" complex projects into simple parts, as we did here.

** Lesson 01: Boolean and Logic Gates
- Basic boolean building blocks are NOT & AND
  - OR(X,Y) can be construct with NOT(AND(X,Y))
- we can further discard NOT & AND by just using [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vtnEP28OuOuxE_SNyYei37tIicGpcogD1NU_nhP-hw4/edit#gid=0][NAND Logic]]: 
  - NOT X   = NAND(X,X)
  - X OR Y  = NAND(NAND(X,X),NAND(Y,Y))
  - X AND Y = NAND(NAND(X,Y),NAND(X,Y))
  - Trivia: NOR can do these too. we call them "universal gates"
- With these we can build up complex functions 
- For logic gates, we start with truth table work backwards to construct functions that can implement addition and multiplication etc.
