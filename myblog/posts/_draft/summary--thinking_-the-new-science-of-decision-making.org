*1 The normal well-tempered mindÂ *\\
*(Daniel Dennett)*\\
- deconstruction technique is usually applied to understand the Mind.
Break stuff down until simple structures are found that can be replaced
by machines. Neurons in this case.\\
- Turns out Neurons are more complex than we thought. They're like
little agents and can form coalitions and fight other groups for
control.\\
- even at the level of genes, there are complex interactions like
these.\\
- so the Mind is like an anarchy/chaotic state rather than orderly
machine.\\
- an organized mind is an achievement. A goal to yearn for.\\
- recent explosion of big data accelerate research. However need more
analytic capabilities.\\
- previously a popular brain model is a logic gate if/then/else. Now
it's a massively parallel fuzzy machine.\\
- Control is key to understanding. How do you control a parallel system.
Obviously not from top - down.
