- Heart rate variability is the best proxy for willpower reserve. You
can increase it by destressing (exercise, sleep, meditation). Quick
boost by breathing slowly (5 times/min).

\\

- Willpower is like a muscle. Keep pushing to grow stronger. Find strong
wants power, use it at your weakest.

\\

Solution: Let any thought flows through you, feel what you feel, but
don't believe it.\\
