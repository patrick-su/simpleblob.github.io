** Thoughts
- original intention of bitcoin is to have decentralized currency, peer-to-peer trading with no middle-man (no friction).
- right now most people just own to for speculations, not actually using it in day-to-day life (except for the underground illegal markets)
- Additionally, there are middlemen who charged a fee on your transactions which defeat the whole purpose.
- still, Bitcoin proponents see this as just the beginning. A time will come where its value is more stable and everyone is using it just to trade, not holding it for investment. (needs checking)
- Still looking for nice fair-value analysis piece from some economists.
