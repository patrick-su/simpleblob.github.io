### Linear Algebra (Matrix/Vector)
- 3brown1blue videos
- basis vectors
 - think of vector as an arrow point on the map, with origin at [0,0]
 - think of basis vector i and j and each x and y coordinate on the map
- linear transformation 
 - the linear transformation can be thought of the squishing or enlarging the nD dimensional space
  - it won't be linear if the origin moves or the spacing becomes unequal
 - we can put the "new" basis vector as column 1, 2,... of the transformation matrix. we use the dot product to apply the transofmration
 - 2x3 transformation matrix means we are squishing from 3D to 2D coordinates.
