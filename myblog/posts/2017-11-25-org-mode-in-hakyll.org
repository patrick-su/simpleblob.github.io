Testing Pandoc's emacs-org file conversion to html, based on this [[https://github.com/turboMaCk/turboMaCk.github.io/blob/develop/posts/2016-12-21-org-mode-in-hakyll.org][page]].

This is the end of post itself. Everything below is just to test how Pandoc handles org files.

* This is H1

There is paragraph under h1

** H2

*** H3

* Some basic test

This is *bold*, /italic/, =code=, ~verbatim~ and +strike+ text.

- However */bold and italic/* doesn't play well when used together like in markdown.

* List

- Bullet
- Another bullet
  - child
    - deep

** Other style
+ Bullet
+ Another bullet
  * child
    * deep

** Other style
1. Bullet
2. Another bullet
   1) child
      1. deep

Style =*= isn't supported.

* Check List [1/3] [33%]
- [ ] Item
- [ ] Item
- [X] Checked item

Heading and has special class however =<ul>= and =<li>= are plain.

* Task List

** TODO some to-do

** DONE done to-do

Items are added with special class.

* Tables

| number | description        |
|--------+--------------------|
|      1 | looooong long name |
|      5 | name               |

=<tr>= has =even= and =odd= classes.

* Source Code

*Emacs Lisp:*

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun negate (x)
    "Negate the value of x."
    (- x))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results output
(print
    (negate 10))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:
: -10

There are interesting classes like =sourceCode= and =example=.
Also there html5 attributes prefixed with =rundoc-=.

*Haskell:*

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell :results output
factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
#+END_SRC

* LaTeX

- *Characters:* \alpha \beta \rightarrow \uparrow \or \and \implies \pi \infty
- *Inline Math:* $f(x) = x^2$
- *More complex:* $\frac{x^2}{2}$

LaTeX characters are wrapped in ~<em>~ and Math inside ~<span class="math inline">~.

** \mathscr{Hello!}

\begin{align*}
  8 * 3 &= 8 + 8 \\
        &= 24
\end{align*}

*NOTE:* /There is standard LaTeX embeded above which is skipped during compilation to HTML./

*This is using* [[MathJax][https://www.mathjax.org/]]

$$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$$

  DEADLINE: <2016-12-20 Tue>
