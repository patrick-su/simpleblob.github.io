<p>Welcome to my personal website/notebook.</p>
<li>I intend to use this as an extension of my memory</li>
<li>Being an online website is handy when I need to reference something</li>
<li>Although I am the main user, I hope the information here can be useful to other people, so I put this on github. (Also, hosting is free -- double plus good)</li>
<li> Using Hakyll + Pandoc + emacs-org for content. We'll see how it goes.</li>
